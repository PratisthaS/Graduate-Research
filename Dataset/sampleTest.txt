PR E FA C E. IN completing the twenty-ninth volume of the Baptist Magazine, and the third series of its numbers, the Editors would respectfully solicit the attention of their numerous readers to a brief retrospect of its history, The work was commenced in the west of England, January, 1809, and numbered among its earliest contributors, in London and the country, ministers and friends of eminent piety and distinguished attainments, as Ryland, Fuller, Hinton, New- man, &c., &c.; who, during the continuance of their esti- mable lives, enriched its pages by their valued communications, and, by their extensive influence, effectively patronized its benevolent design. After having, for some time, encountered the disadvantages almost necessarily connected with provincial management, it was deemed expedient that this periodical should be conducted in the metropolis; and arrangements for that purpose having been effected, the transfer took place in the early part of 1812. Since that period, the Baptist Magazine, in common with its numerous contemporaries, in endeavouring to adjust itself to the rapid increase of weekly and monthly publications, has, on various occasions, attempted such improvements as pro- gressive events appeared to suggest ; and further improve- ments—in reference to typography, &c., were in contem- plation for the ensuing volume. Moreover, in pursuing, through nearly thirty years, its beneficent course, it has had the ho- nour of competing with several confessedly rival publications, and of witnessing these ephemeral efforts become successively defunct.

V - PREF ACE. During a lengthened period, the Editorial arrangements of this work were entrusted to the superintendence of the same individuals, whose gratuitous exertions were uniformly directed to advance the spiritual interests of its readers generally, and the more especial advantage of that section of the Christian community to which its distinctive title refers. As connected with this limited enumeration of facts, it is certainly not the least gratifying, nor one which can be too thankfully acknowledged, that considerably more than four thousAND Pounds, arising from the profits of this work, have been distributed among the widows of Baptist ministers; and it is earnestly hoped, that from the same source, during the next quarter of a century, a much larger amount may continue to flow in that necessitous and honourable channel. And, finally, in concluding their labours and anticipating a change of management—long since contemplated by individuals connected with this periodical, but which events, not subjected to human control, have, until now, prevented—it is not possible that the Editors should omit a momentary re- ference to those by-gone times, connected with the earlier history of the Baptist Magazine, in which, with simplicity of purpose, and intenseness of desire to serve the cause of truth, and promote the interests of the denomination, fraternal harmony and cordial co-operation were habitually associated. Nor will they refrain from expressing the bene- volent wish, that its future progress may be distinguished by whatever is adapted to improve its character, and extend its usefulness.

THE B A PT IS T M A G A Z IN E. JANUARY, 1837. MEMOIR OF THE LATE REV. WILLIAM NICHOLS, OF COLLINGHAM. FRoM the earliest ages of the world it has been customary for survivors to preserve some me- morials of their deceased friends. This practice, which has prevailed in all countries, is not the result of divine precept or of civil enactment, but has, no doubt, arisen out of the essential laws of our intelligent and social nature. The most wild and wandering tribes of savage life, often beguile their solitude with the rehearsal of their traditionary recollections of the dead; and in every con- dition of society, the remem- brance of those who were beloved while living, is held among the most cherished emotions of the heart. True religion has not withheld its sanction from these spontaneous workings of the sympathies of our nature, but has on the contrary taken them under its guidance and control, and thereby rendered them productive of the happiest effects. A con- siderable portion of the inspired volume consists of biographical history, in which the character and conduct of men are portrayed, their vices censured, and their piety and virtues held up to com- vol. xii., 3rd SERIES. mendation. It is hoped that the following sketch of the history of a devoted and exemplary servant of Christ, may be interesting to the readers of the Baptist Magazine. The Rev. William Nichols was born in Nottingham, March 17, 1762. His parents, who moved in a respectable sphere of life, were laudably attentive to his re- ligious education, and their efforts in this respect were happily not in vain : for though during the former period of his youth, his conduct betrayed many most af- fecting indications of the way- wardness of our fallen nature, yet the bias which was thus given to his character, led to a com- paratively early devotement of himself to the Lord. At the suggestion of one of his thought- less companions, he was induced to visit the Baptist meeting-house, where the late Rev. Mr. Hopper was then officiating, and it was there that it pleased God to exert that influence on his thoughts and affections which issued in his con- version. In spite of the opposition of his former associates, he re- solved at once to abandon the - p

Page 2
2 Memoir of the late ways of sin, and to devote him- self to God. He became regular in his attendance on the means of grace, and at the age of six- teen was baptized and admitted to church fellowship. The copious and artless narrative of the exercises of his mind, which from this time he carefully preserved, exhibits in a very interesting and satisfactory point of view, the depth and ardour of his religious experience. In a paper which he drew up in the form of ‘a solemn covenant, he reviewed with evi- dent contrition the iniquity of his past life, declared his cordial acceptance of the gospel, and in strains of the most fervent piety surrendered himself to God, and breathed forth his aspirations after the enjoyment of the divine favour, and full conformity to the divine will. If there be one hour of human life more important than the rest, it is unquestionably that in which the penitent sinner thus enters into covenant with God. Oh who can describe, who can comprehend, the infini- tude of interests involved in that transaction This is, of all others, the one special event in man's history which makes the angels of God rejoice over him. This is the first step in his upward progress to the celestial dwelling- place of these rejoicing spirits. From that hour he ceases to be the captive of Satan, the child of hell, and is made an heir of God and a joint-heir with Christ. The career which Mr. Nichols thus commenced under auspices so interesting, he was enabled, by divine grace, steadily to maintain, through good report and through evil report, till the close of his protracted life. Having entered into the hosiery business in partnership with his brothers, he was several years employed as commercial traveller for the firm. And here, at the outset, the reality of his religion was severely tested. It is difficult for those who have not been them- selves engaged in this department of life, to form any adequate con- ception of the moral jeopardy to which a pious young man, thus employed, is exposed. He has not only to contend with the dis- sipating influence inseparable from such an avocation, but he is also thrown into continual contact with a class of persons, much of whose converse and conventional habitudes is directly militant against his principles. Mr. Nichols soon found that it would require no ordinary vigilance and decision to resist these antagonist in- fluences, but he firmly determined to resist them, and with much difficulty succeeded. Though his avocations as a commercial traveller would ne- cessarily occasion his frequent absence from home, yet such was the estimation in which he was held by the church, that he was, even while thus engaged, elected by them to the office of deacon; and the manner in which he dis- charged the functions of this im- portant office, through a long series of years, made it evident that the confidence which his brethren reposed in him, was not misplaced. His uniform, bland, and affectionate demeanour, his untiring zeal for the welfare of the church, his prompt and be- nevolent attention to the poor and the afflicted, and the regard which he paid to the interests of the young people, and especially to those who were inquiring the way to Zion, combined to render him both beloved and useful in more than an ordinary degree. His

He was “given to hospitality,” and never appeared more happy than when entertain- ing strangers for the sake of him whose servants they were. Thus using the office of a deacon well, he purchased to himself a good degree, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus. In the year 1795 he received from the church another testi- mony of the estimation in which he was held by them. Perceiv- ing that he possessed competent abilities for the Christian minis- try, they conveyed to him an expression of their unani- mous desire, that he would de- vote himself to that work. After much hesitation on his part, and much entreaty on theirs, he con- sented to comply with their wishes, as far, at least, as his other avocations would allow. His first exertions of this nature were confined to the villages in the vicinity of Nottingham, and to the destitute localities which came within the range of his journies. He was greatly en- couraged, while prosecuting these unostentatious labours, by the frequent assurances of success and usefulness which came to his knowledge. But the aggregate amount of good which, in this way, he effected, the revelations of eternity can alone disclose. In the year 1806, the church at Col- lingham, being then destitute of a pastor, and in a very declining state, invited Mr. Nichols to take the oversight of them. With this invitation he at length com- plied ; and in the summer of the following year he was publicly ordained over them. The sub- joined extract from a letter of the late Mr. Fuller, of Kettering, whose advice he had sought on this occasion, will serve to ex- plain, in some measure, the sacri- fices made by Mr. Nichols, for the sake of the church at Col- lingham : “I received yours, and have since seen and talked with brother Sutcliff. We certainly should be glad, for the sake of Collingham church, if you could comply with their request. The only objections, which to us appear of any weight, relate to your trade, and religious connerions at Not- tingham. As to the first, it is im- possible for us, or any other friend, to persuade you to relinquish it. If that be done, it must be a free- will offering of your own to the service of God. All we can say is, if you give up worldly ad- vantages for the sake of promot- ing Christ's interest, we do not think you will lose by it in the end; though it is likely you may have to wait till your Lord cometh, before your account is settled. As to the second, we doubt not, that the brethren at Nottingham would regret to part with you; but we hope they have so much disinterested regard to the cause of God, as to be willing you should be where you could do it the greatest service. If the above objections stand not in your way, we should be very happy to hear of your acquies- cence. Should this be the case, though I get into years, and tra- velling is a labour to me, yet I should delight in coming to your ordination, if you would accept of my services.” From the above communica- tion it is obvious, that the con- duct of Mr. Nichols, in devot- ing himself to the work of the ministry, was in a high degree disinterested. With a benevolence which nothing but religion could inspire, he will- ingly relinquished a lucrative

Page 4

It is plain, that both Fuller and Sut- cliff looked upon his conduct, in this instance, in the light of a costly sacrifice made for the sake of the cause of Christ. This sacrifice he cheerfully made, and the event has proved, that he was not a loser in the end. But in thus acting, he showed the strength of his love to his Redeemer. He prac- tically said, “What things were gain to me, those I counted loss for Christ.” And, indeed, through- out the whole of his life, his disinterestedness was manifest. Whatever other motives influ- enced him, it was obvious, that gain was not his object—that self was not his idol. In his various efforts for the spread of the gospel, there was a marked oblivion of all selfish considera- tion. Possessed of ample private property, he not only waived all claim to remuneration for his own labours, but he also gene- rously contributed to the support of many other poor ministers and churches in his neighbourhood. And, besides his extensive private charities, he was a liberal sub- scriber to the various benevolent institutions of the age, especially to those more immediately identi- fied with his own section of the church. His life, indeed, was a standing rebuke to the selfishness of our nature ; a living, visible exhibition of that divine bene- volence which the religion of Jesus alone can originate and sustain. Nor was he less distin- guished by his deep personal humility. Whenever he spoke of himself, and in all his inter- course with others, he discovered the meekness and humility of a child. It was interesting to ob- serve how this virtue transfused itself through the whole of his demeanour, and shed a softened lustre over all the other virtues of his character. So lowly was the opinion that he entertained of himself, that he often appeared perplexed rather than pleased, when any particular mark of re- spect was shown him. Without undervaluing the courtesies of life, he never seemed to indicate the least disposition to arrogate honour to himself, or to assume that consideration to which his worth so justly entitled him, and which all who knew him so will- ingly conceded, especially during his latter years. There was no- thing of the arrogance, nothing of the high-bearing of the proud man discernible in his spirit or deportment. Having long and deeply studied the character of his divine Exemplar, he had be- come assimilated to the “mind of Christ;” he had learned of Him who was “meek and lowly of heart.” But in nothing, per- haps, was our departed friend more exemplary, than in his habitual spirituality of mind. This could not fail to have been felt by all who conversed with him; and it is still more manifest from the records preserved in his diary. From these it is clear, that devotion was the es- sential element of his being. “He walked with God.” Ever conscious of dwelling in the divine presence, he dreaded, as the greatest of all calamities, a state of mind which God could not approve ; he valued, as the choicest of all possessions, the light of Jehovah's counte- nance, the manifestations of his favour. He watched over the state of his heart, and the work- ing of his thoughts, with the

Page 5

If, in- deed, he erred at all, it was in going to an extreme in this point: in attaching too much impor- tance to the frames and feelings of his mind. Though greatly enfeebled by the infirmities of age, Mr. Nichols continued to preach till within a few days of his death. The first half-yearly meeting of the Notts. and Derbyshire Association was, at his urgent request, held at Collingham. To that meeting he had looked forward with con- siderable interest; and when the brethren assembled, his sinking energies seemed to rally for the occasion. With more than his wonted vigour he joined in the services; but from that period his strength gave way, and after a short illness he peacefully expired on Sunday, Nov. 8, 1835, in the 74th year of his age. JAMES Edwards. ON THE TRANSLATION OF SCRIPTURE. IN religion, as in the study of nature, there are some truths so obvious, and of such common interest, that it is scarcely possi- ble to entertain a diversity of opinion respecting them, without resigning the whole system of Christianity altogether. Some are more obscure ; and others are so connected with external and worldly influences, that without any real want of instruction, a diversity of sentiment becomes almost inevitable. Every individual Christian, on entering the church, becomes a student, whose great business is to learn whatever God is pleased to teach,and to obey whatever God has commanded. But, before he has proceeded far in his studies, he finds himself on one side or other of some question which divides the opinions of his bre- thren. The subject of baptism is not singular, but may serve as an instance. Here the church is divided. One class believes that personal piety is a necessary qualification of the subject, and that baptism is immersion; ano- ther class of Christians believe that personal piety is not a º qualification in the sub- ject, and that sprinkling is bap- tism. Each party may be quite satisfied with its own decision, but the inquirer has to form his. I wish to consider, therefore, what would be the duty of these parties in reference to this inquirer, and also in respect to each other. First, then, it is the duty of each party to recognise their common character and condition. They are disciples and servants of Christ, and nothing more. If, therefore, the sprinkler rise up against the dipper, or the dipper against the sprinkler, enforcing his own views and practices upon his neighbour, without producing, by conviction, a change in his opinion, he assumes an undue authority, and does what is un- seemly to his fellow-servant, and what their common Lord will not approve. Secondly. These two classes of students are bound to cultivate towards each other the kindest feelings of mutual respect. They may be equal in piety, learning, and gifts; and if so, whatever

Page 6
6 On the Translation of Scripture. respect belongs to the one is due also to the other, for they stand on common ground—have com- mon interests, and responsibili- ties. The difference in opinion may, in some respects, be a mis- fortune; but if it be calamitous, it is their own faults. By far the greater portion of their knowledge is believed and valued by both par- ties. In the use of this, they may have fellowship with each other; and the charity which is thus che- rished, might enable them to bear with patience that diversity of opinion, in which each individual is responsible for nothing but his own faithfulness and diligence. Thirdly. Each party in the church is bound to increase as much as possible the facilities for studying divine truth. By this, the interests of all are promoted, and God is glorified. As often as such efforts are blessed, so as to render a point of difficulty and difference quite clear and satisfactory, those who have to submit and change their views, have received by far the greatest benefit. If, therefore, any section of the church should close a source of information on any point that may be felt to be in danger, the guilt of a double crime will be contracted ; first, in the rejection of truth; secondly, in the prevention of its acquire- ment by others; and if the two parties agree to close up one source of information, they not only reduce themselves to volun- tary ignorance, but they also deprive the young inquirer of an advantage bestowed on all by the Author of our mercies. An instance of this folly is seen in the Church of Rome. When that hierarchy had so cor- rupted its doctrine and practice, that they would not bear investi- | gation, it was resolved that the Bible should not be read, except- ing in a language which few or none could understand, but those who had an interest in perpetuating the errors which had been le- galized by human authority. By this means they closed the way of life: first, refusing to enter themselves, and then forbidding other men to enter. At the Reformation, those whom God had raised up for that mighty work, considered this conceal- ment of divine truth a gross viola- tion of divine law. Jesus com- manded all men to search the Scriptures; but Papal authority forbade their perusal—labouring to reduce the world again to heathen darkness. Hence, the reformers concentrated all their energies, and hazarded their lives to provide for their respective nations faithful translations of God's Holy Word. But when the translators of King James provided the version which is now authorized in England; because there were some . Papal errors which that Monarch did not wish to be reformed in the church, they left some parts of the Scrip- tures untranslated. Those which relate to the constitution of the church were regarded as danger- ous, because he believed that where there was no bishop, there could be no king. But the errors respecting baptism were stated to be too trivial to be corrected. The word baptizo, therefore, and its derivatives, were left un- translated; and thus the authori- ties of England joined hands with those at Rome, in concealing that, part of God's Holy Word which did not agree with their prac- tices: and every argument used by the reformers to condemn the practice of Rome, may justly be

Page 7
On the Translation of Scripture. 7 employed in reprehending the rtial concealment of sacred truth which they have admitted for their own purposes. Men love darkness rather than hight only when their deeds are evil. And, whether the instance appear to them important or in- significant, those who add unto or diminish the words of their Redeemer, perform an act which is unseemly in students and ser- vants, and which is full of rash- ness. But though the obedience we owe to our Redeemer in a sacra- ment of his own positive appoint- ment be boastingly represented by his own ministers as a thing of no importance: it deserves to be considered, that the act of baptism is frequently contrasted with other actions, which deserve to be considered in connexion with it; because, in order to make the contrast very obvious, precise and particular expressions are always used in the Scriptures to describe them. Such is the act of washing away actual or ceremonial uncleanness from the person of an individual; which is always expressed by Xovo, lowo, or wroxova, apolowo. The act, too, of 'washing or scouring his gar- ments, when, through previous pollution, great effort is required, has a particular word to express it, ºrxvyw. And the act of rinsing the hands, or face, or feet, for convenience, or for refreshment, as they were accustomed to do at their feasts, or religious wor- ship, where no uncleanness was necessarily implied, had also its appropriate word, wºrra. Hence we frequently find, 1. Xava, loud, to wash the person of an individual. 2. www.w, pluno, to scour or wash his clothes. 3. ww.rw, nipto, to rinse his hands, face, or feet. 4. 8xwtºw, baptizo, simply to immerse him. 5. payrºo?, rantizo, to sprinkle water, &c. upon him. 6. exxsw, eccheo, to pour upon him water or oil, as they did when they anointed their priests, &c. To the clear and precise trans- lation of these words, there is more importance attaches itself than would at first sight appear to an indifferent observer. First. Because they are fre- quently so contrasted in the same sentence, that the meaning of each word must be precisely given before the passage can be under- stood. Aovo is thus contrasted with wºrra, in John xiii. 10.- Xovo, and aroxova are both thus contrasted with 3&ºrrºw in Acts xvi. 33, and xxii. 16. We find 3arrºw, gavrica, and 7.00% oc- curring under similar circum- stances, in Heb. ix. 10, 19, 21, and x. 22, 23, &c. While 3ozºr- ricw, gavri'a, and ºxxiw are in many other passages than those which I have mentioned, so com- bined and contrasted as to admit of no other than a literal and precise translation.” Secondly. Because X.ova, wro- ×ova, and gavric w are frequently used in Scripture to describe the atonement of Christ; and no obscurity ought to be thrown upon the meaning of words that are employed to communicate a doctrine so intimately connected with our best interests, and there- fore so important to be under- stood by us all. Thirdly. Because these words occur so frequently in describing the transactions in the Jewish temple, that until they are clearly and precisely understood, it is * Levit. xiv. 15–17.

Page 8

Because the proper meaning of these words is the principal, and indeed the only means which God has given to direct us in performing a sacra- ment of his church, and a sacred duty, binding on us all. And though there is no case in which the true meaning of God’s words ought to be considered a subject of little importance, yet, in the present instance, we ought to feel the more concern; because, being a case which involves the ground of every believer's hope, and the rule of every believer's practice, the truth requires to be stated with so much perspicuity, that the wayfaring man, though a fool, might not mistake it; and to be given with so much point, that he who reads may run. . Still, whatever be the impor- tance which attaches itself to the subject, it is hard to conceive of a plan more completely adapted to obscure both the meaning of the words and the passages which contain them, than the one on which our translators have pro- ceeded. For, First. Aovo, azoxoval, and wºrra, which, with their derivatives, are used in the New Testament about twenty-eight times, and indeed sometimes 8arrºw itself with them, are all translated by the verb, to wash, without any discrimination whatsoever ; and no one, unacquainted with the original, would ever dream, that in Mark vii. 1–4, and John xiii. 10, Acts xxii. 16, with Acts xvi. 33, this one word (wash) stands t Epistle to the Hebrews throughout. for four different words, differ- ing from each other in their meaning, and contrasted with each other in those very passages.” Secondly. The word ravva oc- curs but once in the New Testa- ment, Rev. vii. 14. There it requires a strong term to express the effort necessary to make those garments that were once very unclean, pure and white as they appear in heaven. But the in- definiteness of the term by which it is translated, has washed out the strength and spirit of the passage. The same uncleanness, and the same effort in removing it, are implied in the use of 2.092 and orož.ovo, and even gavr1%2, when used in a religious sense. But with respect to the use of wºrro and 827-142, the case is quite the reverse. They frequently express an action, which indeed may remove a trifling inconve- nience, but which could not be called uncleanness: and some- times rather indicates a deter- mination to maintain a state of purity already possessed, than an effort to acquire it. Thus, those who have been lustrated (washed) need nothing more than just to rinse (wºrrow) their feet.t And John does not ask the Pharisees, &c. to be made clean by his baptism, but he requires them to become clean before they are baptized. In the common use of these words, therefore, there is some- thing in the former three, which beautifully prepares them to de- scribe the provision which God has made to heal those that are sick, and to cleanse those which are unclean ; whilst the latter is, by the same means, prepared to express an act, which, in a dis- * See Campbell's Gospels, Mark vii. 1–4. John xiii. 10. t John xiii. 10. f Matt. iii. 7.

Page 9
On the Translation of Scripture. 9 ciple of Christ, should be a sacred pledge of perpetual devotedness to him by whose grace he had been born again. For this very reason, we find that Xovo, acro- 2.092, and gavric w, are often used to describe the atonement of Christ; but wºrro, and 32+rºw are never used for that purpose, while the former three are never used in reference to the sacrament of baptism. This act, because it supposes the subject to have re- ceived the benefit of that atone- ment which they describe, is ex- pressed by 8arrica, alone. But any one will find it difficult to make out this difference from his English Testament. Thirdly. The word 8arrizo, with its derivatives, is used in the New Testament about one hun- dred and twelve times. And whilst in the former case four Greek words are expressed by one English word (wash) which con- ceals the difference between their several meanings; here one word, which is never used in Scripture in a second sense, is so written as to appear three, each of which is said to differ from the others in its meaning. For wash is not synonymous with dip; and it takes a deal of trouble to per- suade some of our brethren, that to dip is the same as to baptize; and yet the expressions rendered to wash in Mark vii. 3, 4, and to dip, in John xiii. 26, and to bap- tize, in Matt. iii. 16, 17, are after all nothing more than repetitions of the same word, 8wºrri?o. Now, if our translators felt themselves perplexed with a cere- mony which, at that time, had been newly introduced to their church by the supreme authority of the nation ; and if on that ac- count they wished to borrow and naturalize this word, 8wºrricov, instead of translating it, they ought at least to have borrowed it in every case in which it is used ; they would then have given us a little (though but little) chance of fishing out the meaning for our- selves. This, however, is much less than we had a right to expect; for, since the subjects described by these words are of the last im- portance, and the words so used and contrasted as to be in danger of being confounded with each other, they ought not thus to have destroyed the force of God's word; but if they had determined to borrow the word 8arrºw, they ought to have borrowed all the other words which were so con- nected and contrasted with it, as to require its translation. And, since they had commenced this system of borrowing, they ought to have carried it so far as to bring out the meaning and the point of every passage, and to make them obvious to plain men. If, however, this, by exciting too much curiosity and discussion, would have defeated its object, and exposed them to censure ; they had only one other plan on which they could proceed, i. e., to have translated them all, and 827 ruca, with them, and to have written dip or immerse, which- ever they pleased, in every passage where it occurred. Whether the Baptist denomina- tion can be justified in submitting for so many years to use such a version in their own country for the sake of peace, I shall leave others to determine. Certainly they have not thereby obtained the credit of being peaceable, and I from my heart believe that my brethren are wrong. But when zeal for God and love for souls placed our first missionaries C

They translated the words, and the Bible Society honoured their fidelity by render- ing them its support. But when this very translation had been im- proved by many years of labo- rious study; and presented to India with the highest literary testimonials of its accuracy and taste ; because that portion of the church which objects to baptism had gained a footing there, and found that the translation of these words was fatal to their practice, at their request the Bible Society refuses its support: and thus our fellow-servants forbid the transla- tion of their Saviour's words. I would not write thus relying on my own judgment alone; but, from the highest ranks of our oppo- nents, authorities may be produced in formidable multitudes; first, to prove that our translation is cor- rect; secondly, to show that the subject is of weighty import: and yet, like the translators of our English version, in the very teeth of their own testimony, they re- solve that the words shall not be translated until some form of expression can be found which implies that sprinkling is the same as immersion. If these brethren be our equals, by what authority is it that they do these things 2 If they be our superiors, then we have their superior tes- timony to prove that our practice is right, and that their resolution is wrong. At a distance of more than half the circumference of the globe our missionaries had found a sphere for devoted labour; they were peacefully cultivating their vineyard when agents from our opponents reached the place. They not only taught their own peculiar sentiments, and exhibited divisions before the heathen ; they have laboured incessantly, and finally succeeded in stopping the circulation of God's holy Word, until the translation which we had made was modified to their practices. I will not undertake to describe the consequences of such an act. The following cen- sure, though I think it harsh, may perhaps be admitted as it comes from the pages of our opponents, and was written on the same sub- ject. “Those who would weaken Christian love or unity among Christians, especially those of the same congregation, for the sake of making proselytes to such non-essential, non-important prin- ciples and practices, or who would pursue their work at the risk of such love and unity, are the pests of society, the curse of the church of Christ. “Mark them,' says the Apostle, “which cause divisions and offences con- trary to the doctrines which ye have learned, and avoid them.’ They are almost always restless, proud, and party-spirited men. We cannot give them credit for prin- ciples better than some or all of these. They must be doing some- thing, if it be mischief. They must make themselves noticed, because perhaps they are not noticed so much as their pride tells them that they ought to be ; and they naturally wish to have their opinions supported by the numbers who embrace them, whether they will stand the test of sound argument or not ; whether they are trivial or im-

These reckless men care little for these things, so they can but promote their own party; and no censure is too severe to pass on those who would make such things the badge of a party, a line of demarcation between Christians, or the wedge to rend asunder those who are already armited.”* I have before stated that I think this too harsh, and I differ from my charitable fellow-student in reference to the ground of his censure. But while the conduc- tors of that work can thus dis- honour and blame an act of indi- vidual and conscientious obedience, how will they support a public resolution for which candour itself will find no apology save in the very principle they thus condemn? A more glaring case of mis- conception will scarcely be found in modern times, than that which is presented in the paper above referred to. The author seems to have no idea of the re- sult to which his own positions must lead him : and, consequent- ly, every reprehension inflicted on his brethren, returns with tre- mendous violence on himself and his own party whenever au ap- peal is made to fact. His sword is sharpened for execution; but, when about to thrust his friend, he holds it by the blade and not the hilt; and, consequently, the wound inflicted must be on his own person. If, as servants and disciples, Christians are all equal, then no one has any right to ascend the tribunal and condemn his fellows. Infallibility belongs to God alone. It is rash, therefore, and full of hazard when a man, who is of yesterday, presumes to declare, that a command which our Lord has registered by inspiration is not sufficiently important for us to obey. It is still more hazardous when this same man will blot the register of his Lord's command that his brethren might not peruse it. But it is hard to conceive a point where presumption can be more appalling, than for a servant, who had been forgiven much, and re- deemed by grace, to venture on exhibiting the study and ob- servance of his Saviour's will, as a folly to be derided and as a crime for which “no censure is too severe.” C. Srovel. Dec. 7, 1836. COMMUNION WITH SLAVEHOLDERS. To the Editor of the Baptist Magazine. DEAR SIR, I beg the insertion of the follow- ing remarks in your Miscellany, in reply to the paper of Christianus on communion with Slaveholders. To me it would be a cause of great surprise, and of deep mortification * Evan. Mag. Dec. 1836.-p. 543. too, if, among the members of our denomination, strong doubts con- cerning the lawfulness of com- munion with modern Slaveholders had not arisen. And why any who have objected to such com- munion should shun an appeal to the word and the testimony, I can- not conceive. By the decisions

Is not the distinction which “Christianus ” makes between Slavery as a political evil, and something that is not “abstract- edly sinful,” fallacious 2 Every political evil that involves the un- deserved abridgment of human rights is a violation of the princi- ples of rectitude; and such viola- tion is, certainly, in all cases, “abstractedly sinful.” If the distinction be valid, the abolition of Slavery would be wrong. For, evidently, the distinction of that which was not essentially sinful, could not be a holy deed. More- over, how has it occurred that, if Slavery is not abstractedly sinful, Christianity, in its progress, has effected its abolition ? Does that sacred system destroy something beside sin 7 Does it, in its career, deface any of “the beauties of holiness?” While “Christianus ” asserts that Slavery is not “ab- stractedly sinful," yet he tells us it produces “cursed fruits.” This is “passing strange,” and since his trees yield conversely, he of course plants “thorns and thistles,” in the expectation of gathering “grapes and figs."—But surely “Christianus,” cannot mean to affirm that a system founded in man-stealing, that most heinous of all robberies, is not “abstractedly sinful;"—that a system which must subject its victims to numerous woes, which deprives them of all right in themselves, in their wives, in their children, in their labour— and which makes them, although immortal beings, the chattels of others, is not “abstractedly sin- ful." If such a system is not “abstractedly sinful," then I ven- ture to conclude, there is no sin in the universe. “Christianus" will perhaps, allege that the above evils are the abuses of Slavery, and not slavery in the abstract. Here, Sir, lies another fallacy. Slavery in the abstract is Slavery no- where. What fine-spun fancy is abstract Slavery “He that hath a dream" on this subject, “ let him tell it." Is a system meant that should not originate in steal- ing rational creatures—that should not claim a freehold in man—that should not despoil the husband of his wife, the father of his child— that should not withhold from the servant “that which is just and equal 7" Such a state, I main- tain, would not be Slavery ; and with it, therefore, the ques- tion at issue has no connexion. Really it is “high time" we had done with such abstractions; let us, in the name of justice and mercy, speak of slavery as it actually exists, and has existed for ages. But lest “Christianus” should charge me with reluctance in appealing to the Scriptures, permit me to inquire, whether they enjoin communion with the mo- dern holders of Slaves? Of Slavery as it now exists—the Slavery I have just described—the sacred writings know nothing. It did not exist among the Jews. Their bondsmen were either their bre- thren, or the surrounding heathen. The bondage of the former was either voluntary, or in payment of just debts; and unless the parties serving willed to the con- trary, their servitude was tempo- rary. The bondage of the latter was the judicial visitation of Hea- ven upon a guilty race; and its permission was an act of divine mercy, since it commuted the sentence of extinction into that

Page 13

And, more- over, Slavery even of this kind cannot now lawfully exist, until the parties practising it can pro- duce a commission from God, similar to the one in virtue of which the Hebrews subjected an outcast race to permanent bond- age. Allow me now to examine the records of the New Testament. And here I readily concede to “Christianus" that believing Slave- holders and believing slaves of a nominal description, and believers who were neither the one nor the other, did, under peculiar circum- stances, freely commune together. But I hope to be able to prove that this case, and that on which we are at issue, are so entirely dissimilar, that no reasoning from the one to the other can be valid. —I submit the following points of distinction. 1. Ancient Slavery originated in conquest. Slaves were usually regarded as the political enemies of their masters,and their bondage, as the punishment of their hostility. Modern Slavery is founded in man stealing. The crime of carry- ing on a national, continuous, and legalized robbery of men was un- known in the ancient world; its perpetration in the days of mo- dern enlightenment was reserved for the professed followers of the merciful Redeemer. Our Slavery is the forcible detention of stolen men, or of their descendants; and how such an act, whether viewed in the abstract or the concrete, can be any thing but sinful, I have yet to learn. 2. The character of ancient Slavery differed essentially from that of our own times. In the former case, the brand of a pro- scribed colour did not attach to the servant; his proper manhood was not disputed, his condition did not greatly differ from that of the subordinate branches of the family into which he was incor- porated; the child of the Roman. during his pupilage, was, in a legal point of view, as much a slave as his servant, Gal. iv. l. No iniquitous laws forbade the cultivation of the bondman's in- tellect, or the emancipation of his person; he could rise to the mental dignity of the logician, the poet and the philosopher; e. g. Terence. Modern Slavery is, no- toriously, of a directly opposite kind.—I do not intend to insinu- ate that Grecian and Roman Slavery, either in its origin or character, was not sinful; but to prove that the Slavery of modern times is, in comparison, “exceed- ingly sinful.” “Christianus" may assert that these distinctive fea- tures do not affect the principle involved in the controversy ; and therefore I remark that, 3. The Slavery of Greece and Rome was not tolerated in the primitive church. For reasons which must be obvious to every one, the first teachers of Christi- anity could not directly insist on the enfranchisement of Slaves. If they had done this, the banner of the cross had become the standard of sedition; and every herald of its truths regarded, by both masters and servants, as another Spartacus. But the writings of these “holy men of God” were directed to the vir- tual extinction of Slavery in the church. Without stopping to make lengthened reference to the fact that the doctrines and spirit of Christianity are incompatible with Slavery, I remind “Chris-

Page 14
14. Importance of Union. tianus” that the inspired penmen affirmed the state to be inconsis- tent with the rights that the re- deeming Lord had in his people, I Cor. vii. 23. Conjugal, parental, and social duties were inculcated, the due discharge of which was not compatible with a state of Slavery. They recognized the right of the servant to himself, and to equitable remuneration for his toil. They taught that “ in Christ Jesus there is neither bond nor free." They enjoined on be- lievers to esteem them, to whose permanent services they were legally entitled, “not as slaves" but above slaves, even as “brethren beloved.” Now I ask “Christianus," if primitive masters in their conduct towards their servants had not acted on these principles, whether they would not have been worthy of exclusion from the “communion of saints;” and whether, therefore, those American churches which confess. edly do not act upon them, ought not to be withdrawn from as “bre- thren that walk disorderly 2” “Christianus,” surely, is bound cither to prove that they do act upon these principles, or to allow that communion with them is un- lawful. In order to strengthen this conclusion, I observe finally that, 4. The circumstances in which these churches in America are placed, widely differ from those of the primitive churches. The most civilized regions, when they flour- ished, were sunk in heathenism. The prejudices of mankind, the entire ignorance which prevailed concerning civil and religious rights, and the stern despotism of the government, rendered the free discussion of Slavery wholly im- practicable. The United States of North America are professedly Christian, enlightened, and free. The topic of Slavery has been canvassed by the civilized world for half a century; Christians in America have been reasoned with, warned, and entreated ; “a band of men whose hearts God hath touched,” has arisen among them, who have “cried aloud, spared not, and lifted up their voice like a trumpet, to show the people their transgressions,” and the Christian church “their sins.” Earnestly do I hope that British and American Christians will per- severe in seeking to gain their brethren ; and that they will suc- ceed in “winning their souls” from tenaciously grasping a system which embodies more iniquity, and has inflicted more suffering, than almost any one by which our globe has even been desolated. But while they persist in their adher- ence to “the accursed thing.” Christians, I hope I have proved, are bound by the most sacred obli- gations, not to commune with them, but to separate from them. Only let such separation be effected in the spirit of love, and accompanied with ardent supplication to “the Father of mercies, that he would turn them from the error of their way.” J. Webb. Stonehouse, Dec. 10, 1836. THE IMPORTANCE OF UNION, To the Editor of the Baptist Magazine. S1 R, In speaking of the report of the Baptist Union in your review of that interesting document, your reviewer says it is “the most va- luable document we have for a long time been permitted to an- nounce.” In this opinion I fully

Page 15
Reply of the Rer. C. Storel to Kappa. 15 concur, and trust that a very ex- tensive circulation of that report through the denomination, will produce a very extensive benefit. But, Sir, I must be permitted yet to complain, that it presents the denomination before the world in an unfavourable light; as being still more like a “rope of sand” than a “three-fold cord.” The word “unassociated,” attached to so many of our churches, is by no means creditable to such churches, nor to us as a body. It appears that, out of 1158 churches, there are only 581 (not half) of them associated, and not more than 289 in the Union. Have we yet to learn the great advantages of union and co-operation, and the mutual benefits of “brethren dwelling together in unity?" Oh, when will the intercessory prayer of our Lord be answered, “that they all may be one " Are we not “one body in Christ, and members one of another ?” It is surely high time that all the “un- associated” in different districts, should immediately unite with their sister churches in county associations, and that all such as- sociations should join the general union. REPLY OF THE REV. I beg to acknowledge the suggestions of an unknown in- dividual who, in the last number of this work, was kind enough to notice my strictures on Elihu. His object is most laudable; for nothing can be more important than that all controversy should be sweetened with Christian charity. But efforts to diffuse it are most likely to succeed, when characterized by simplicity, and manly faithfulness. Kappa would have done better therefore, if My complaint, which applies to most of the counties in England, has a special bearing on the churches in London and Middle- sex, of which the report gives eighty, and of these it appears only eighteen are associated, and not more than thirty have filled up the statistical columns. Now, Sir, I do think the London pas- tors and churches should feel their responsibility to the Head of the church, for the influency which their example is calculated to ex- ercise on the United Kingdom. While I thus write, I cannot but congratulate the committee on the success which has attended their labours, in the evident improve- ment which has been made during the past year, and which is suffici- ently encouraging to induce them to persevere, until the whole de- nomination shall be as the heart of one man : when this shall be the case, we shall not fear to em- bark in any great or good work to which we may be called, as there is nothing but what might be ac- complished by united hearts and combined energies.

If I were to treat him with severity for this, I know not how he could complain, but I prefer using an apo- logy suggested by his own paper. Kappa obviously does not per- ceive the gross impropriety of this practice : consequently, in defend- ing Elihu, he uses the following sentence, “So that no man

Page 16
16 Reply of the Rev. C. Stovel to Kappa. must even anonymously presume to differ from his betters, without being assailed for his temerity.” It will be advantageous to him, therefore, if Kappa will bear in mind, that no man whom God has endowed with reason can, by conscientiously using it, incur the charge of temerity, though he should be so unfortunate as to differ in opinion from every other man on earth; for avowing his opinion, he rather deserves respect than blame, if he do it properly: but he who assumes a false name, for the avowed purpose of dis- honouring individuals who are known, and of dividing a society in which he was received with confidence, deserves neither re- spect nor lenity, until he has re- signed his mask, and confessed his error. This was the object of my severity with Elihu ; I meant to remove his disguise, which has been done; but since Mr. Burgess has avowed himself, I desire to treat him with the utmost cour- tesy, and to prevent, if possible, his suffering any material injury from his rashness. But Mr. Burgess has not been “loaded with abuse ;” and, if he and Kappa do not yet see “the fallacy of his reasonings and the weakness of his cause,” I merely recommend a re-perusal of the Strictures. This will enable Kappa to perceive also that the sentence (“If this does not give you a better understanding and produce speedy repentance”) which he has marked as a quota- tion, is not to be found there. I do not wish to press on him an acknowledgment of this inac- curacy, though this is the only ground for his censure; it will be quite sufficient if Kappa will be more careful in future; especially when he intends to blame. Respecting “ the firebrand thrown into our temples by the adversary,”—and Kappa's de- mand of facts, I have only to say, that, at least before I give him facts, I must know who it is that requires them. I fear that this unknown friend must have but little knowledge of our affairs: still, there is one passage in his reply that might serve to satisfy his own inquiries. “The present position of our body is highly’ critical. The question of American slavery threatened us with a schism. The decision of the Bible Society must now, it seems, be another apple of discord. If, as has been repeatedly insinuated, these seeds are sown by the enemies of our prosperity, our conduct should be regulated by the greater cau- tion. Will sarcasm and abuse heal, or foment, division ?” I answer, they will most cer- tainly foment division, and not heal it. On this account I con- sidered that the curious com- modity which Mr. Burgess boast- ingly calls “Christian sarcasm”— and the abuse which under a false name he poured on his own brethren, ought to be so re- prehended as to make their author known. “Human nature cannot but kindle at the application of such a torch; yet, let the devastation of the flame be attributed to him who flings the fire-brand on such combustible materials.” “The personality of religion is our tower of strength;” but this is not strong until it is rendered consistent and of universal applica- tion. The sophism of Kappa, and the unfaithfulness of Mr. Burgess, therefore, must be both resigned, before our position can be invul- nerable. C. Srov EL. Dec. 3, 1836.

Poetry. 17 SUGGESTIONS IN RELATION TO THE DESTITUTE STATE OF SEVERAL OF OUR CHURCHES. To the Editor of the Baptist Magazine. Sir, I shall be glad to avail myself of your help in giving currency to a thought, which appears to me entitled to more consideration than it could command, if uttered within my own circle, or under the influence of my name. My knowledge of the churches in our own denomination, and somewhat of their history and circumstances, is not inconsider- able ; and I have more than once endured the affliction of losing an able and beloved pastor, with all the depression of mind attendant on a church in a state of desti- tution; and the anxiety involved in the search for, and choice of, a new pastor: but I never re- member a period when so many of our most important stations were vacant, and our brethren “cast down.” In such circum- stances every Christian church feels the need of divine support; and how efficacious is a spirit of prayer, in drawing more closely the bonds of mutual affection, endangered (through the infirmi- ties of our nature, and the de- fects incidental to the voluntary principle, invaluable as it is,) by such a calamitous visitation; and in keeping the minds of the mem- bers in the attitude of “waiting upon" the Chief Shepherd; while their energies are directed in search of a pastor, whom “He shall own and bless" Some doubt rests upon the minds of many Christians, amid these difficulties, as to what is right, with respect to giving invitations to ministers who appear to be both happily and usefully settled ; and this is a subject to which some of our most experienced brethren would do well to direct the atten- tion of your readers; both as re- gards settled pastors, and desti- tute churches. But my present object is, to suggest to all our churches, particularly those who are enjoying the sunshine of the divine presence, that they should make special prayer for such as are destitute and afflicted. And I venture to predict that, if a united meeting for prayer could be held by our London and sub- urban churches, early in January, at some central chapel, with im- mediate reference to this object, it would be well attended ; and might prove an abundant source of edification and comfort! If you think well of the idea, and can lead to its practical adoption, you will oblige, PHILo-PAstor. One other year now added to the score, Admits the reunedy the past denies: All that was erring in the past deplore, Now upward bend thy steps, and live to self no Indre. Soon all our years will pass away, and seem But traces of a being on the mind. The memory retains them like a dream, But he who seeks in yonder world to find That solid bliss this earth can ne'er supply, May greet past years that help'd him on his way, As gales that wa?t him to the distant sky Where all is bliss, and one unclouded ray sº- ReflecTiONS ON THE PAST YEAR.

The sermons of Dr. Clarke can never be recommended to preachers as models. They are compositions of an order very much after their own kind, and unlike any other. Like his Commentary, they contain a great deal of information and exhibit much learning, but thrown together in strange confusion. Something is to be found in them of almost every sort which the anti- quary, the scholar, the divine, and the man of general knowledge could bring together, but in such singular conjunctures and collocations, as makes you wonder, by what possi- bility they could be so associated. On the theology pervading them, we make no remark; it is of course Arminian, and sometimes, as we think, repulsively so. But this is no more than was already known ; and all that our duty, in the present instance, requires, is, that we should state the fact, without making it the occasion of controverting the posi- tions of the system. Sometimes passages occur on experimental reli- gion, of great force and beauty ; especially we could instance some in which the inward peace of the newly-converted sinner is described, when, for the first time, he enjoys a sense of pardon and reconciliation with God. Take the following: The man becomes unutterably happy. Instead of guilt he has pardon; instead of an inward hell he has heaven. He feels. that God is reconciled unto him through the Son of his love. The fear of death, and the fear of hell is taken away; and he anticipates the glory that shall shortly be revealed. By the eye of faith he sees heaven, girds up the loins of his mind, starts from the right point, takes the true road, looks right to the prize, and runs for eternal life. If we give another extract, it must be one that shall characterize the author. Dr. Clarke, though not to be describcd as an original thinker, thought still in his own way, and illustrated his thoughts after a method of his own — exem- pligratia: The prayer of the apostle for their in- crease in all spiritual excellence: “Grace and peace be multiplied unto you,” &c. Most children understand what multiplication is; all learners have this definition ready at land. Multi- plication is the act of increasing any number by addition, or production of more of the same kind. Multiplication has the multiplicand or number to be multiplied ; the multiplier, or number given, by which the multiplicand is to be multiplied ; and the product, or num- ber produced by the other two. Will those who mind high things, condescend to men of low estate; or will they excuse me for doing it ! Then I will produce the first question I ever wrought in this rule ; and out of the very same book—Fisiit it's Arithmetic ; How much is 3 times 472 multiplicand 3 multiplier 1416 product. Now suppose grace and peace to be multiplicands, or numbers to be multi- plied; then choose any number, say 2, or on to 12, which may be called sim- ple multipliers, because they may be easily done in one line; suppose, then, we take 144, which is 12 multiplied by itself, and make it the multiplicand, and 12 (the last and highest number in the Pythagorean or multiplication table) as the multiplier, and let this sum, 144, stand for grace and peace, and 12, the quantity by which you wish to have this grace and peace increased, thus, 144 12 1728 Then this product, 1728, marks the quantum of those graces which you wish to possess, beyond that which you at present enjoy. So far, surely, you can believe the possibility of hav- ing those graces increased in your soul; and when perhaps you consider the small quantum of grace and peace which you possess, and how much more you must obtain before you are fit to see God, you will at once perceive Answer 3

Review.—An Efficient Ministry. 19 that, great as this increase is, it is yet far less than you need. Then consider again that this product may be made a multiplicand, and capa- ble of being multiplied by the same mul- tiplier, thus: 1728 multiplicand 12 multiplier 20736 product Twenty thousand, seven hundred, and thirty-six. This is a vast increase; and yet you can easily conceive the possi- bility of this increase being multiplied, and then the product would be the im- mense sum of two hundred and forty- eight thousand, eight hundred, and thirty-two! and this sum multiplied in the same way, will produce the grand amount of two millions, nine hundred, and eighty-five thousand, nine hundred, and eighty-four ! and all this in only five multiplications ! This is a vast increase; and yet this, and far beyond this, can God make his grace abound towards you. And as there are no bounds to God's mercy in reference to man, and none to the wishes and capacity of the human soul, you can easily conceive the possi- bility of this product being again multi- plied, as the preceding seems [sums], till the increase would soon be too great for our powers of calculation to compre- hend; “grace and peace,” says the Spirit of God, “be multiplied unto you.” Who can tell you how much is comprehended in this word 2 This is no trifling, nor is it merely condescending to men of low estate; it is, on the contrary, teaching wisdom among them that are perfect, for the apostle prays that the family of God may be “filled with all his ful- ness.” Letters on the Present State of the Visible Church of Christ.

Mr. Beverley has recorded his name amongst these candidates; but whether he will attain to the dignity, time, which proves all things, must determine. We have great pleasure in observing a real improvement in his present work, when compared with former pro- ductions. There is less passion and reproachful sarcasm in it; and, on the whole, a visible approximation towards Christian charity may be traced in several of its pages. But Mr. Beverley has much to do before he has attained the ac- curacy which is necessary for gene- ral usefulness. His remarks on the early ages of Christianity can scarcely be used with safety; and his statements of the present are often not more correct. If, for in- stance, any one should read his letter on the present state of the Christian ministry, and his repre- hension of the charges delivered by Dissenters at their ordinations, and then turn to the excellent dis- course of Dr. Reed, it will not only be seen, that Mr. Beverley's com- plaint has been anticipated by the men whom he labours to expose ; but, also, that the very man to whose reprehension he has devoted a whole chapter, has, with more accuracy and greater power, ex- pounded his own thoughts, and eclipsed him in all that is desirable. Another instance of inaccuracy will be found in statements relating to American piety. The great crimes which make up the system of slavery call for our tears; and, like our own colonial system, can- not be too severely reprehended. But it does not follow from the miserable condition of aboriginal tribes in all our territories, that we have no religion. If the allegation were made, Mr. Beverley himself would be produced as an instance to falsify the statement. Others, perhaps inferior, would be placed by his side for the same purpose. Although the exterminating curses of our colonial system are to be deplored, there is piety in England, which sends out our missionary to the sufferers. There are, also, men who mourn over slavery in Ame- rica, who reject its gains, and de- precate its atrocities; and no ad-

The aristocracy of the skin, with its pernicious results, has not had all the attention which was due to it from Mr. Beverley. To the deputations he has given two letters; on these we shall not offer any remark that will change the neutral ground we occupy in conducting this periodical. But as the book was sent us by Mr. Bever- ley, or his bookseller, to be no- ticed, we feel bound to state, that the letter of instructions Mr. Bever- ley referred to, page 109, never had an existence. All opinions respect- ing past affairs we reserve; but, since this supposition is now brought forward again as the basis of a grievous censure, we feel bound to state, that the supposition is entirely UN rous ped Mr. Beverley will, of course, consider whether there be not something unmanly and cruel in thus assailing the reputa- tion of individuals, in reference to affairs which he has neither the power nor the right to examine. The public acts of any Society must be liable to discussion ; but its private arrangements, with its own agents and members, ought to he too sacred for such unwarrant- able interference. We regret these blemishes, be- cause the work contains some hints of importance which deserve to be brought before the public without this disadvantageous association with error. The Seren Ages of England. By Chantrs Williasis.-Westley and Davis. pp. 608. History has for a long time been too much confined to the operations of war, so that the progress of its pages is marked by the arrange- ments of bloodshed and victory. Be- sides the injustice through which an undue importance is thus given to one class of human affairs, the effect of its study is rendered per- nicious, especially to our youth. Past ages should be reviewed, in order to increase our intelligence and piety. To promote this, Mr. Williams has here given a history of our advancement in “Arts, Litera- ture, and Science, from the Earliest Ages to the Present Time.” His effort deserves the highest approba- tion, and the greatest encourage- ment. Young persons of all classes wi'l derive inuch interest and im- provement from the study of his pages; and with the following spe- cimens of his style we recommend the book with great satisfaction. Extraordinary Speeches.—The first turnpike road was established by an act of Parliament in the reign of Charles 11., but so great was the insensibility to the improvement, that the mob pulled down the gates, and the new plan was supported and enforced at the point of the bayonet. Long after this period, however, travelling was both difficult and dangerous. It is also worthy of remark, that a fear of what would now be called im- provements was cherished by the higher ranks, and that many things which have been actually accomplished, were then considered totally impracti- cable. Thus, for instance, in April 4, 1671, the second reading of a bill was moved in the House of Commons, “for building a bridge over the Thames at Putney.” On that occasion Sir William Thompson thus spoke:– “Mr. Speaker, London is circum- scribed, I mean the city of London; there are walls, gates, and boundaries, the which no man can increase or ex- tend ; those limits were set by the wis- dom of our ancestors, and God forbid they should be altered. But, Sir, though these landmarks can never be removed—I say never, for I have no hesitation in stating, that when the walls of London shall no longer be visible, and Ludgate is demolished, England itself will be as nothing—though, Sir, these landmarks are immoveable, indelible, indestructible, except with the constitution of the country, yet it is in the power of speculative theorists to delude the minds of the people with vi- sionary projects of increasing the skirts of the city, so that it may even join JWestminster.” Mr. Boscawen said, “If there were any advantage derivable from a bridge at Putney, perhaps some gentleman would find out that a bridge at Westminster would be a convenience. Then other

Page 21
Review.—Mrs. Stevens' Selections. 21 honourable gentlemen might dream, that a bridge from the end of Fleet-market into the fields, on the opposite side of the water, would be a fine speculation ; or who knows but at last it might be pro- posed to arch over the river altogether, and build a couple more bridges, one from the palace at Somerset-house, into the Surrey marshes, and another from the front of Guildhall into Southwark. (Great laughter.) “‘Perhaps some honourable gentle- men who were interested in such mat- ters, would get up in their places, and propose that one or two of these bridges should be built of iron 1 (Shouts of laughter.) For my part, if this bill passes, I will move for leave to bring in half-a dozen more bills, for building bridges at Chelsea and at Hammersmith, and at Marble-hall Stairst and at Brent- ford, and at fifty other places besides.' (Continued laughter.) Mr. Low declared it to be the opin- ion of the “worthy chief magistrate,” that if any carts go over Putney bridge, the city of London was irretrievably ruined ' and added, that the river above London-bridge would be totally destroyed as a navigation. In the present day, it is not only highly amusing to read these denuncia- tions of misery and ruin, but we are thereby reminded of the º of hu- man judgment and foresight. Not only is there a bridge at Putney, but the fore- bodings of Mr. Boscawen are almost all realized as relates to the erection of bridges; although not so as to their de- solating effects on the city of London. A bridge at Westminster is found to be a convenience; another has been erected from Fleet-market into the opposite fields, at Blackfriars; even the “couple more” are really in existence, and nearly on the sites pointed out—the Waterloo and Southwark bridges; and, what is still more remarkable, it has not only been “proposed,” but one of these (the Southwark bridge) is actually built of iron. Sir William Thompson, had he lived to the present moment, might have sought in vain for the walls of London. Lud- gate-bar is demolished ; the “wall, gates, and boundaries, set by the wisdom of our ancestors, which no man could in- crease or extend,” have disappeared. London is extended on every side, so that the skirts of the city are not to be distinguished by a stranger from West- Intraster. The conclusion of this remarkable debate is not less deserving of notice. Sir Henry Herbert, just before the house divided, said: “I honestly con- fess myself an enemy to monopolies; I am equally opposed to mad, visionary projects; and I inay be permitted to say, that in the late king's reign several of these thoughtless inventions were thrust upon the house, but most properly re- jected. If a man, Sir, were to come to the bar of the house, and tell us that he proposed to convey us regularly to Edin- burgh, in coaches, in seven days, and bring us back in seven days more, should we not vote him to Bedlam : Surely we should, if we did him justice; or, if another told us he would sail to the Indies in sir months, should we not pu- nish him for practising upon our credu- lity? Assuredly, if we served him rightly.” Selections from a Correspondence on Sub- jects connected with Christian Faith and Practice; with an Introductory Pre- face. By Mrs. Stevens. pp. 237. Ha- milton and Co. The letters, from which these se- lections have been made, were writ- ten to several persons by a pious and amiable lady, who “will not affix her name" to the volume. Some of them are designed to remove the doctrinal difficulties of inquirers in the way to Zion; others, to pour comfort into the mourner's cup, and wipe away his tears : benevolent purposes which they are admirably adapted to fulfil. To such as are perplexed with the inquiry, “What shall I do to be saved?” the uni- form advice of the excellent author is, “Go to Jesus first: you must not think that corruptions are to be grappled with and overcome, and then you shall have joy. Come to your Father in the way his own Spirit has pointed out. Say unto him, Take away iniquity, and re- ceive me graciously; then shall the blessed fruits of pardoning love follow.” To the tempted she gives the judicious advice to distinguish carefu?ly between being tempted and sinning. The afflicted will find the alleviations of almost every form of sorrow pointed out in these pages: and without pledging our- selves to every sentiment the vo- lume contains, we readily recom- mend it to our readers.

BRIEF NOTICES OF RECENT PUBLICATIONS. Sacred Pneumatology, or the Scripture Doctrine of the Holy Spirit; in three books. By the Rev. Joseph Wilson, A. M., Minister of Larton, Northamptonshire. pp. 358. Seeley.—We have very seldom met with a volume, on this important branch of theology, which has afforded us so much pleasure as the work now before us. The worthy author, we think, must have been richly rewarded in this labour of his hands, though we are far from supposing that his remuneration will be limited to the refined and exalted pleasure which we are pre- suming he must have experienced while preparing these pages for the press. Indeed, though we hope his finances will sustain no injury by this publication, we are far from calculating, as we trust he also is, by the amount of pecuniary result. The approbation that will be expressed ; for it is said, “them that honour me, I will honour;" the benefit which we believe numbers—we hope multitudes—will derive from the perusal of this truly excellent treatise, will un- measurably exceed the highest ratio of commercial per centage. In all which, so far as the author’s knowledge may extend, he will largely participate. Mr. Wilson divides his work into three books, “On the Divine Nature, Person, and Attributes of the Holy Spi- rit—On the extraordinary Operations of the Holy Ghost—On the ordinary Ope- rations of the Holy Spirit, as a Sancti- fier, and Comforter, and Intercessor.” The first book is subdivided into four chapters, the second into five, and the third into the same number. We have no doubt as to Mr. Wilson being sincerely attached to his commu- nion ; but as a servant of Jesus Christ, what must have been his feelings, in re- ference to the ministry, in that connexion generally, when he wrote as follows — “To educate, therefore, young men to the ministry, without reference to their real inclinations, desires for its sacred functions, is to send wolves and not shep- herds among Christ's flock, to desecrate the most holy of all employments, and to form blind leaders of the blind.”— p. 172. But our estimate of this pro- duction has too deeply interested us in the pious author, to permit us to add another word upon a subject which, whenever it engages his attention, and that cannot be unfrequently, must in- duce suffering which we earnestly wish could be conscientiously diminished. We are happy, in conclusion, that we can most cordially recommend this work on “Sacred Pneumatology,” to the atten- tion of all our readers. Going to Service; a Sequel to “My Station and its Duties.” By the Author of “The Last Day of the Week.” pp. 230. Seeley.—It may be expected that patron- age judiciously conferred will be attend- ed with the happiest effects. The au- thor of this small volume supplies us with an illustration. The favourable re- ception of his former publication has in- duced a succession, which, while it is highly creditable to his piety and indus- try, is calculated to be exceedingly be- neficial to a very numerous and impor- tant class of readers. We think “Going to Service,” is likely to prove, in the connexion for which it is intended, a great favourite. We consider it to be well entitled to the attentiºn of mis- tresses as well as servants. Walks and Scenes in Galilee, Judea, &c. pp. 115. Seeley.—The reader will find himself conducted, by the help of these pages, through the principal incidents of the Redeemer's history. The senti- ments are spiritual, the style is attrac- tive, and the design is excellent. The Christian Gift, containing a Har- mony of the Sacred Writers, Concerning the Deity and History of Jesus. By Christopher Bell, Esq., A Member of the Honourable Society of the Inner Temple. Second Edition. pp. 330. Ward.—Mr. Bell has been well and piously occupied in constructing this arrangement of evan- gelical truth. The biblical student may consult it with advantage. It by no means supersedes the use of other har- monies; for though, of course, it presents much in common with them all, it fur- nishes some things peculiar to itself. The Family Liturgy; being a Course of Morning and Evening Prayers for a Fa- mily ; arranged and Compiled on the plan of a Liturgy. By the Rev. R. Waldo Sibthorpe, B.D., &c., &c. pp. 185. Seeley.—The author of this devotional book, proposes to make family worship resemble the responsive service of the Church of England. In domestic use, however, it will not be as in public im- posed. It may, therefore, be adopted, or partially used, or omitted altogether, as those who have the election may deem most edifying. The author's name is quite sufficient to induce the persua- sion that this production of his pen is

Edited by the IRev. Edward Morgan, M.A., Vicar of Syston and Ratcliffe, Leicestershire. pp. 477. Seeley and Burnside.—The eminently pious and devoted author of these “es- says, letters, and interesting papers.” neither lived nor died to himself. Of him it may be truly said that, when living “he worked the work of the Lord ;” and though, now, alas, he is dead, “he yet speaketh.” The essays contained in this useful volume, of different lengths and various, are in number twenty-two; the letters exceed three score; and the miscellaneous pa- pers amount to seven. No serious reader can rise from the perusal of these pages without the conviction that their writer was “a holy man of God.” The work will be found to comprise a rich and varied repast of experimental religion, admirably adapted to refresh and strengthen the renewed mind. Whatever may be considered as defec- tive in the attractions of style is abundantly compensated by evangelical savour. fe are so satisfied that it is calculated to be extensively useful, that we earnestly hope it will obtain an en- larged circulation. The Doctrine of Particular Providence, or the Divine Guardianship over the most minute Concerns of Man; Illustrated and Defended in Biographical Reminiscences. By George Pilkington, late Captain, Corps ºf Royal Engineers. . pp. 297. Wilson. –Upon the whole, this is an interesting volume, yet the interest is of a mixed character. The early part of the work contains numerous incidents, some of which are certainly striking, perhaps we might even say romantic ; but the latter part exhibits statements of procedure which we can neither admire nor com- mend. Our veneration for divine pro- vidence will by no means permit us to concur in the manner in which Mr. Pilkington endeavours to identify its operations with all his pursuits. In his plan of subsisting, he appears to us to throw an onus of responsibility on the providence of God, which, were persons less shrewd, and more scrupulous than himself to attempt, would speedily over- whelm them in abject poverty, if not merited contempt. Christian Sympathy. By John Howard Hinton, M.A. Jackson and Walford. pp. 48.-A very useful little work, in which the author has presented to the churches valuable instruction on a most important subject. We hope to see it obtain a wide circulation ; and still more, to witness an universal prevalence of that vitalizing charity which it is intended to inculcate. Hints to Religious Ladies on the Impor- tance and Adrantages of Mental Cultiva- tion. Seeley. pp. 48.—Women hardly know their own importance, and are scarcely aware of their responsibili- ties. As wives and mothers they have to command respect and affection, and should therefore be enabled to diffuse in- telligence, animation, and enjoyment over their respective domestic circles. In this age, when the claims of charity and the occupations of benevolence make such large inroads into the time and energies of young females, they are in danger cf overlooking the advantages of having a mind well stored with in- formation. We hope these well meant “Hints,” will contribute to deepen the sense of these advantages, and induce our fair readers to cultivate the “wondrous mind” which God has given them. Knowledge does not make woman less lovely ; for ignorance or affectation no charms can compensate. Reply to Mr. Pum’s “Word of Warn- ing in the last Days.” Fellowes. pp. 127.- Such of our readers as have read the little book of the reverend vicar of Willian, will find from this pamphlet that His Reverence is no prophet. Had not the ex- travagancies of Mr. Pym's school of in- terpreters prepared us for almost any- thing, we should have been shocked at his presumption in determining the limit of the time within which our Lord's appearance is to be looked for. Christ says, as to his coming, “Of that day and hour knoweth no man.” Mr. Pym says, though we cannot tell exactly when he will come, we can tell that he will have appeared before the year 1847. The pamphlet before us is a calm and ju- dicious examination of the accuracy of Mr. Pym's calculations, and of the force of his arguments. The respected author has no wish to abate a single point of the word of warning necessary in the last days. He is, however, anxious that this warning should rest on no fanciful inter- pretations, no unwarranted guesses, no presumptuous conclusions. We would urge on our readers his advice, to care- fully study the Holy Scriptures, to watchfully correct our sinful motions, and to diligently obey the commandments of God in doing our appointed duties, and working all the good we can in that sphere which Providence has allotted us.

24 OBITUARY. CAPTAIN JOHN PUDNER. Captain John Pudner (son of Mr. Gilbert Pudner, whose memoir is re- corded April, 1829, vol. xxi.) was born of pious parents, in the year 1761; he received a religious education, and, at the early age of 17, went to the East Indies, received an appointment in the Honourable Company's Service, in which he was promoted, and continued with integrity and fidelity, to the day of his death, esteemed and respected by all who knew him, both in India and Eng- land. Entering young in life on a new scene of action and temptation, and being of a lively turn of mind, he freely mingled with other youths in the gay and fascinating amusements by which he was encircled in India. Possessing natural talents, having a good education, and habitually of a frank and cheerful disposition, he was courted as a pleasant facetious companion in numerous social circles. This ensnared and betrayed him into a habit of levity, which, though subdued and governed as he advanced in life, was perhaps never entirely over- come. This disposition and tendency, of which he was conscious, proved, in maturer years, a source of sorrow to him, fearing it might occasionally have been indulged to excess. But the moral and religious impressions which he had received in early life, deepened, and became more influential in his conversation and habits as he advanced in years, and was much more apparent and decisive through his gene- ral character and conduct. In 1806, a bilious fever endangered his life in India, and occasioned his coming to England, intending, on the establish- ment of his health, to have returned again to India; but God in his gracious [..."; appointed otherwise, and rought him under the Christian minis- tration of the Rev. Mr. Humphrey, late of Hammersmith, and of Mr. Lei?child, of Kensington, which, being blest to the awakening of his conscience, and con- vincing him of his guilt and danger as a sinner, he was induced to retire from service in India, and to remain in Eng- land, that he might enjoy the privilege of continuing to attend the means of divine grace, and the ministry of the gospel—the value and importance of which he was now convinced of. About this time, he removed to Hack- ney, where for some time he profited under the useful ministry of Dr. Cox. In the year 1819, he was called in pro- vidence to reside at Liverpool, where he joined the Baptist church, under the pastoral care of the Rev. Mr. Lister, whose instructive ministry, and affec- tionate Christian vigilance, he ever bore in grateful remembrance. In 1822, being appointed by the Court of Directors Paymaster to the Honourable East India Company's Depot at Chatham, this appointment obliged him to remove to Rochester, where he closed his mortal course. He was grati- fied in being selected to this official civil engagement, as he wished to be freed from military service. He found the neighbourhood of Chatham not the most favourable to religion, but here he main- tained a firm, consistent adherence to his Christian principles and profession. This was evident by his attendance on the public and social means of religion, and his regular habit of retirement for serious reading, and devout reflection and study, with a view to promote his moral and spiritual improvement. It was his diligent endeavour to aid the best interests of all who were within the compass of his influence and advice. He was ever ready to encourage and assist every worthy effort to instruct the ignorant, to relieve the pious poor, and reclaim the guilty wanderer to the paths of virtue and religion. Many will feel the loss of his benevolence and sympa- thy. But his last illness and sufferings most satisfactorily develop his Christian principles and feelings. He sustained acute pain with patient resignation to the divine will. In the immediate pros- pect of death and eternity, he calmly commended himself, in faith and hope, to the divine mercy. Through his ill- ness, he had a deep, and sometimes a depressing sense of his sinfulness but expressed a firm faith in the efficacy of the sacrifice of the Redeemer, to atone for human guilt, and of the sufficiency of his perfect righteousness to justify the believer. After a severe attack of pain, on being asked how he was, he replied, “I am in much pain, but it is the mind, the mind ''” evidently intending, that, great as his bodily sufferings were, they were less than those which were mental. At intervals, he exclaimed with ardent feel- ings :

Page 25
Religious Intelligence. 2.5 “Show pity, Lord, O Lord forgive, Let a repenting rebel live,” “Could I but read my title clear,” &c. Yet in those shaded seasons, hope and confidence in God were evinced, and he would devoutly say, “Rise, my soul, and stretch thy wings, Thy better portion trace.” Though exercised by agonizing suffer- ing, he was, through grace, preserved from murmuring, and relieved when any friend read or quoted Scrip- ture to him, and it always gave him pleasure to pray with and for him. He would utter ardent, devout responses to those petitions which met his present case and feelings. A few days previous to his death, he addressed his servants on the importance of remembering their Creator in the days of their youth, warning them to avoid all evil associa- tions, and especially the profanation of the Lord's day. About this time, he was happy in his mind, and rejoiced in God his Saviour, and would often repeat verses of several hymns which were familiar to him, as “Jesus, I love thy charming name,” &c. “Come, thou fount of every blessing,” &c. and would attempt, though with a tremulous voice, to sing, till he was quite exhausted. Previous to his death, he encountered great mental conflict, but was enabled earnestly to pray for relief, saying, with ardent importunity, “Search me, O God, and know my heart,” &c. On being asked if the import of this verse was the sincere desire of his soul, he replied, “Oh, yes, yes!” and with extended hands and weeping eyes, repeated the same words throughout. He never after this ex- pressed a doubt or fear of his state, was much engaged in ejaculatory prayer, and referred to his near approaching disso- lution with composure and resignation, saying, “Into thy hands, O God, l commend my spirit !” On being asked how he felt, he replied, “I am dying.” His attendant said, “I hope you will go to heaven.” He answered, “It is more than a hope.” Being held up when sinking through weakness and pain, he was told that an attendant was support- ing his back, he said, “That is kind, and God is within upholding my heart;” and soon added, “God, my supporter and my hope, My help, for ever near.” After this, he was incapable of speaking, and, without a struggle or a sigh, serenely departed this life, in the 76th year of his age, on the morning of the 19th Sept., and was interred in the dis- senting burying-ground, New Road, Rochester, in the same grave with his aged Father ; on which occasion, his esteemed friend, Dr. Cox, delivered an impressive address; and, on the following Lord's-day evening, Rev. Mr. Thompson preached an appropriate funeral sermon to a numerous assembly, at the chapel, Clover Street, Chatham, from 2 Timothy ii. 3, “A good soldier of Jesus Christ.” Hackney, G. B. October 24th, 1836. RELIGIOUS INTELLIGENCE. SCOTLAND. In our last number we inserted a Paper signed “Socius,” in which an earnest appeal is made to the members of our denomination, and, especially to such among them as are wealthy, residing in Scotland, to aid in establishing a Baptist Theolo- gical Institution, in connexion with one of the northern universities. To this im- portant subject we wish to recal the attention of our friends. Cordially do we unite with the enlightened and zealous writer of that communication in the senti- ments he expresses. Personal knowledge also, of the present state of our denomi- nation in Scotland, to some considerable extent, enables us to express a decided conviction that the measure proposed, subject of course to such mºdifications with regard to its practical details, and perhaps, to the location of the seminary, as further inquiry and conference may suggest, is scarcely less practicable than it is desirable. There are not wanting many excellent men in different parts of that country in the cities and great towns, and in the rural districts too, who are deeply anxious to see their own denomination placed on another footing from any it has yet occupied among them. To effect this object two things under God would effectually con- tribute. One is the introduction of talented ministers into such places as Aberdeen -

Let them lay their plans wisely and persevere. If they should want assistance from their brethren in the south, we are persuaded they will find it. Only let it be seen that they are in earnest themselves—that their hearts are warm—their heads discreet—their counsels united—and their hands li- beral, and we much mistake the character of the leading men in our denomination, if they do not obtain what countenance and support they may need. Editon. *...* It appears that there are several inaccuracies in the list of Baptist churches printed in our last, and we are particularly desired to state that it was not prepared by our excellent friend, the Rev. Robert Thomson, of Perth. the baptist cause 1 N scoti, A No. (A Letter sent to a Baptist Friend.) My dear Sir, I have just read your admirable let- ter to and cannot resist the temptation to address the man from whom such sentiments proceed, on a subject that has long engaged my at- tention; and the more 1 reflect upon it, the more I am impressed with its im- poitance. The subject to which I re- fer is, the supplying of the large towns of Scotland, which are not already sup- plied with at least one talented and de- voted Baptist minister. Something must be done, Sir; it will never do that while all is activity around us, such masses of the population, as are still in a state of ignorance and irreligion, should be left by us, without an effort being made to throw in among them, through the in- strumentality of an efficient ministry, a portion of that truth which is destined ultimately to raise the world from its deep degradation. And, moreover, if we are convinced that we have made a nearer approximation to the principles of the New Testament, than others whom we ever recognize as Christian brethren, surely it does not become us, in apparent apathy, to make no effort for the propa. gation of our sentiments. But how can we expect even to maintain our present position, low as it is, without men of gifts and energy, to feed our souls, and bring our principles before the world ! It has long been a subject for lamenta. tion, that in most of the large towns of the north, there is a class of minds, for which no adequate provision is made in the ministrations of the sabbath; yet. these are the minds that, in general, give the tone to public sentiment; and what a pity is it that Christians of the same order of mind should not unite their energies to gain the influence of such to the cause of their heavenly Master 1 Many of this class, in most large towns, are the dupes of infidelity, looking down with contempt on the dwarfish sabbath-exhibitions of many of those who fill the office of the mi- nistry, some of whom, it must be con- fessed, are far beneath them in mental acquirements. And many intelligent Christians, also, of almost all denomi- nations, are languishing in a state of mental starvation, under ministrations, which, with all their esteem for the piety of the parties, they cannot respect as at all fitted to expand and elevate their minds. But were groups of such persons gathered around men of supe- rior talents, who can tell what might be effected, under the blessing of God, to whom after all, we must be indebted for success; but whose plan of operation in this world embraces in general, a suitableness of instrumentality, without which the end contemplated is not at- tained. Might we not expect that, from Christian societies of the more intelligent and influential members of the community, congregated under able pastors, there would emanate inferior agencies to christianize, in the highest sense of the term, their surrounding neighbourhoods? Might we not expect that, under such superintendence, hid- den talent would be elicited, fostered, and cultivated for the work of the mi- nistry at home and abroad Might we not expect that, through such instru- mentality, the springs of Christian libe- rality would be made more abundantly to flow, for the invigoration and exten- sion of the religious and charitable in- stitutions of the land 2 In one word, might we not expect that, altogether, a much higher tone of Christian senti- inent and action would be diffused over society. But the great question with us is, How are we to obtain such an instru- mentality? Not, in my opinion, by the isolated efforts of individuals, or even Christian societies, which are generally small and feeble in those localities where such instrumentality is most

I have conversed with persons well acquainted with the denomination in England, who gave it as their opinion, that there would be no very great difficulty in obtaining men of competent talents from England, if sufficient encouragement to remove were presented to them. Now, it has occurred to me that if a few individuals like yourself were to take up the sub- ject heartily in behalf of one or two of the principal towns at first—say Dundee and Aberdeen; suitable persons might be found to make an attempt to raise congregations; and if they succeeded, the plan might be followed up in behalf of other towns, such as Paisley, Inver- ness, Montrose, &c. You remark, in your letter, that, “though there were but ten Christians in the country, upon them alone would lie the obligation to promote its Christianity.” Now, surel among the Christians who think wit us, there might be ten found, who, in the first instance, would be willing uni- tedly to guarantee a competent provision for one or two able men, till they should succeed in raising such congregations as would be able to provide for their per- manent support, which I am convinced they would soon do, in any of the princi- pal towns of Scotland, in the present ex- cited and unsettled state of public opin- ion. Most gladly shall I be one of the ten ; and I have no doubt that, if the scheme be thought at all practicable, the other nine will soon be found. Nay, I doubt not that, were the instruments ap- pearing, more tens would soon make their appearance, to employ them. Men of a superior order of talent, I cannot doubt, would soon find themselves surrounded by intelligent and influential congrega- tions; but without such, I despair of seeing the Baptist cause raised in Scot- land. Soliciting your opinion respecting the plan which I have thus briefly submitted to your consideration, I am, &c. Aberdeen, –— 1836. - P. S. To our English brethren, I beg to remark that, the time seems now to be come when every denomination must in a great measure depend on itself for the support of its institutions. I may appeal to every succeeding deputation from the Missionary Society, whether it be not becoming more and more diffi- cult to draw resources for the mission, from other Christian bodies. In such a state of things, therefore, it is surely bad policy, to say the least of it, to lose the produce of so important a field as the north of Scotland, from sheer want of labourers to cultivate it. Only send us a few men of sterling talent, ardent piety, and determined zeal to begin with, and you will doubtless soon receive an ample return, in an increasing revenue to all your great denominational under- takings; but, let us dwindle away a little longer, and, unless help come from some quarter that we at present know not, your journeys beyond the Tay will be nearly as unproductive as agricultural labour expended on a Greenland iceberg. REGISTRATION of Biaths, etc. (Circular from the Office of the Registra- tion Commission, 22, Downing Street, 2nd December, 1836. SIR, -*. The Commissioners who have been appointed by His Majesty to inquire into the state of Registers or Records (not being parochial) of Births, Baptisms, Deaths, Burials, and Marriages, have directed me to transmit to you the in- closed paper of Questions," and to request that you will afford to them, upon the several points, at your earliest convenience, all the information which you may be able to supply. For the purpose of showing the bene- fits that may result from this inquiry, and with the hope also of securing the concurrence and co-operation of all parties interested, the Commissioners have instructed me to state the principal subjects to which their attention will be directed. They will be as follows: 1st. To inquire into the state, custody, and authenticity of such Records; 2nd. To inquire what measures can be most beneficially adopted for collecting, ar- ranging, depositing, and preserving them—for giving full force and effect to them as evidence, and for facilitating the production and reception of them in Courts of Justice. It is evident that the successful accomplishment of these objects will very materially promote the interests of the non-conforming classes of the community. The information, which is requested in answer to the inclosed Questions, will be necessary for enabling the Com- missioners successfully to discharge the trust consigned to them. The Com- missioners therefore reckon with confi- dence upon the assistance of all parties, * See the following article.

The proposed ". will extend to the Registers or Records, of the de- scription above mentioned, belonging to all the non-conformist churches or con- gregations—such as the Roman Catho- lics, the Quakers, the Jews, the Scotch Churches in England, and also the Churches of Forei Protestants in England. But I am ãº to observe, that this Circular Letter is more parti- cularly intended for the Ministers, Offi- cers, and Trustees, or other leading Members, of Protestant Non-Conformist Churches in England and Wales. The Commissioners are very desirous, for the purpose of obtaining the best information by actual and minute in- spection and examination, that all exist- ing original Register Boºks or Births, Baptisms, Deaths, and Burials, and of Marriages before the passing of the Marriage Act in 1753, should be trans- mitted to them. Registers belonging to any Congrega- tion in London or the neighbourhood, may be delivered to me at this Office any day between eleven and two o clock. Any Register Book belonging to a Congregation in the Country, not ex- ceeding five pounds weight, may be inclosed in a cover, directed as follows: oN his MAJESTY's service. The Secretary of State, Home Department, º Ji hitehall. Commission. and may be delivered to the nearest Post Office. Where it exceeds that weight, it may be directed as follows: oN his MAJESTY's service. The Secretary of the Registration Commission, 22, 1)owning Street. and may be sent (as an ordinary parcel) by the Mail Coach, or other safe con- veyance. I am further directed to request, that when any Register is delivered or trans- mitted, a Certificate or statement should accompany it, according to the inclosed Form,” to be filled up as far as can be done ; and that such Certifi- * This “form,” which will doubtless accom. ; any the Circular, it was deemed unnecessary for us to print.—Ep. cate should be signed, either by the Minister or by one or two of the Trustees or Church Officers, or by such other person as can supply the informa- tion required; in the latter case, the reason why no Minister or Trustee or Church Officer signs, should be stated. The Certificate may be annexed to the inside of the Cover, or to the first blank page of the book, or of the first or last book of the series, where there are more than one. The Commissioners will take charge of the Registers entrusted to them, and be ready to redeliver them, if required. But it will be most advisable, that they should not merely be produced for in- spection, but that they should remain under the charge of the Commissioners, in order that at the close of the investiga- tion, they may, if the Legislature should so provide, be safely transferred to the custody of the Registrar-General, or to such other depository as may be direct- ed ; and also, that the most effectual means may be adopted for imparting to them, as documentary evidence, more weight, and a fuller legal sanction than they have hitherto received. To those who may feel objections to the depositing of the Dissenting Regis- ters in a Central Public Office, I am in- structed to observe, that when the general system of Registration, appointed by the recent Act, shall come into ope- ration after the 1st of March, 1837, the necessity for keeping Registers at the Dissenting Chapels will cease, and there will consequently be danger of their being lost :--at all events there will be great and increasing difficulty in proving, for legal purposes, that the document produced in a Court as a Register Book, comes from what such Court will consi- der as the proper custody. There ap- pears to be no adequate provision against these inconveniences, except the plan of depositing and arranging the documents in a Public Office, when the object of their continuance in private custody shall be at an end. The Commissioners are aware, that some inconvenience may arise from the transmission of Registers which are in present use, 'since the substitute, pro- vided by the late Act for a General Registration, will not come into opera- tion till after the 1st of March ensuing. Should any such inconvenience be appre- hended, the Commissioners will, if de- sired, return the Register with the least possible delay. This may be done with regard to congregations in London, with- out difficulty, but, with regard to con- gregations in the Country, the Com-

You will greatly promote the speedy and effectual discharge of the duty en- trusted to the Commissioners, by doing all in your power to make this commu- nication known to your congregation, and also in any quarter from which you think information may be obtained. For this purpose, duplicates of the Questions and of the Certificate are inclosed, and additional copies may be obtained from this Office. Any letters in reply to this Circular, or with reference to the subjects herein mentioned, may be sent by the post, addressed as follows: ON HIS MAJESTY'S SERVICE.

S1 R, I cannot think of leaving London without expressing, what I deeply feel, my unfeigned gratitude to Christian friends for their liberal attention to the object of my visit to Britain. To this gratitude they are not more entitled for having given, than for the manner in which they have given. The cheerful- ness with which contributions have been made both in England and Scotland has often reminded me of Macedonian libe- rality, “They prayed us with much en- treaty,” &c. Expecting soon to leave my native land once more, to join my beloved brethren in Canada, I carry with me grateful remembrances of British liberality and Christian love. A consi- derable sum is yet necessary in the first

Good books on literature or religion, as it might be supposed, are scarce in Canada; so, also, are philoso- phical instruments. To supply us with a few of these would be conferring a great benefit; permit me, therefore, to beg attention to this point. Elementary works in Greek and Latin might be of great service to us, though now of little use to the owners. I conclude with the hope that this will not be overlooked by our numerous friends. May the blessing of them who are ready to perish, still continue to rest on my much loved country Farewell. John Gilsion e. Camberwell Grove, Dec. 15th, 1836. The Rev. J.
